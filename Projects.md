### [This Website](https://github.com/AgentK9/Me)

This website has been quite fun to build, and I plan to add more and more over the coming years. Currently, it acts as a sort of online resume, but I hope to morph it into my blog and general website as time goes on.

### FIRST Tech Challenge

#### JavaScouting2020-iOS

While not on my GitHub, I have been working on a SwiftUI-based iOS app. This app would hopefully be able to support future years of FTC easily by having awesome Swift data structures and robust programming. At the moment, however, it is under development. Look out for it in the coming months!

#### [JavaScouting2020](https://github.com/AgentK9/JavaScouting2020)

This is the main python script for the JavaScouting app. As before, it runs off of a Google Form/Sheet duo, and this script turns that data into something actionable, especially match (both qualification and elimination) predictions.

#### [JavaScouting2020-Java](https://github.com/AgentK9/JavaScouting2020-Java)

This was a short lived try to port the Python version of this to Java. It turns out, I know how to code in java, but creating a project from the ground up is not my cup of tea.

### FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)

#### [JavaScouting 2019 (iOS)](https://github.com/AgentK9/JavaScouting2019-iOS)

I started out the 2018-2019 FTC season using a Google Forms/Sheets pre-match scouting system, which, while useful, was not the most accurate. This was the successor to it, utilizing UIKit and Google's Firebase to make a completely usable app. I also collaborated with [Noah]() from FTC Team 13426 on this app. He made a really cool onboarding screen [here]().  It was never finished or deployed, but it is still usable with some general tweaking.

I will likely never revive this project, however, as I much prefer SwiftUI to UIKit.

#### [CAD (Spectrum-CAD-Library)](https://github.com/AgentK9/Spectrum-CAD-Library)

Since I joined FTC in 2016, I have been my team's main CAD person. When I found out that there was a github repo with tons of CAD in it, I couldn't wait to get in on it.

Since I first found this repo, I've transitioned to mostly using GrabCAD for CAD backup/version control, but that may change in the future. Git is just too nice.

### App Development

#### [FoodTracker](https://github.com/AgentK9/FoodTracker)

This was simply a slight spin off of Apple's tutorial app, available on their website. It was UIKit based, and, while workable, it was not my own project.

### Minecraft Mods

#### [LockMod (1.7.10)](https://github.com/AgentK9/LockMod)

This was the first mod that I made, which simply had a block and a key. This block was indestructible except with the key.

#### [TMF Too Much Food Mod (1.7.10)](https://github.com/AgentK9/TMF-TO-MUCH-FOOD-Mod)

This was an attempt to make something like a Pam's Harvestcraft like mod.

#### [SeaCraft (1.7.10)](https://github.com/AgentK9/SeaCraft)

I wanted to make a mod that improved the sea, as I did not like 1.8 when it came out, and I wanted more from it.
